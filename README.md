# Evennia Tutorial Project

Welcome to my Evennia tutorial project! ðŸŽ‰

This repository documents my journey as I follow the [Evennia](https://www.evennia.com/) tutorial. My goal is to learn more about Python and the Evennia framework while laying the groundwork for creating my own MUD (Multi-User Dungeon).

## Long-Term Vision

My ultimate aim is to develop a MUD inspired by the **Mutant Year Zero** tabletop RPG, but with my own personal spin. I plan to adapt the rules and mechanics to better fit the vibe of a retro 80's or 90's game, blending nostalgic aesthetics with modern gameplay elements.

## Why This Project?

- **Learn Python**: Strengthen my Python programming skills through practical application.
- **Master Evennia**: Gain a deeper understanding of how to use Evennia to create text-based multiplayer game.
- **Creative Expression**: Combine my love for retro games and tabletop RPGs into a unique project.
